Time spent: 1 hour spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Custom numeric keyboard to avoid illegal inputs to textfields
* [x] Enter any percentage for tip
* [x] A 'split the check' function to calculate the cost per person
* [x] Choose a gradient background in the settings screen. Preffered background is remembered between app launches
